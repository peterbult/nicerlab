# nicerlab

The nicerlab package offers x-ray timing analysis tools for python. The goal of
nicerlab is not to present a comprehensive timing library, but rather to give a
framework of efficient processing methods and convenient data classes. These tools
are intended to be used as building blocks for a customized python-based pipeline.
